            <h3>The Beginning</h3>  
            <p>Basketball was not a popular sport back when it was invented. If you read the <a href="origin.html">origin page</a> you know that basketball was meant to be an indoor sport during the winter. So how did it become a world phenomenom and how did it go from being a literal basket to a glass backboard and a metal rim? It was more than just the basketball that was changed. It was how the players played, their equipment, a basketball court, and basketball shoes. In the beginning, players wore knee pads and ran around in Converse. </p>

 
            <h3>Present Day</h3>
            <p>As of today arenas, shoes, and the entire game of basketball has evolved due to many influences such as unique basketball players, the science behind shooting a ball, and different coming together.</p>
